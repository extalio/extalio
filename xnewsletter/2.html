            Going through Twitter and blogs every day and filtering through the junk takes too much time. We figured others are having the same problem. Which is why we decided to compile a list of the interesting content that was published lately. We will publish every few weeks (when enough exciting things have happened).

        <h3>
            Vulnerabilities
        </h3>
        
        <a href="https://abiondo.me/2019/01/02/exploiting-math-expm1-v8/">Exploiting the Math.expm1 typing bug in V8</a>
        <p> 
            A comprehensive and well-written writeup of the Krautflare 35C3 challenge. The bug is incorrect type information in V8 (optimization is missing the -0 return case of Math.expm1). Goes through an explanation of the bug and primitives construction to code execution. 
        </p>
        
        <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=888926">UAF in chrome AppCache</a> 
        <p>
            AppCache is a deprecated but supported Chrome mechanism for storing local resources for offline browsing. The renderer interacts with AppCache via IPC messages. The bug is a UAF when AppCache destructor is called.
        </p>
        
        <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/01/09/3">Three vulnerabilities and exploits in systemd-journald</a>
        <p>
            systemd-journald is a daemon responsible for event logging.
            Both CVE-2018-16864 and CVE-2018-16865 are essentially stack clash vulnerabilities achieved when a program calls syslog() with the received command line arguments (which can be multiple megabytes long).
            The exploitation process is detailed as well - CVE-2018-16864 uses a race condition, and CVE-2018-16865 uses CVE-2018-16866 to leak the stack pointer and the address of the libc RW segment.
        </p>
        
        <a href="https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3351">RCE in Libzmq</a>
        <p>
            A classic, well-explained, heap overflow. Caused by an insufficient buffer size check, allowing to overridea function pointer - which is called later during program execution.
        </p>
        <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/409850">XSS in Steam React chat client</a>
        <p>
            7.5k bounty from Valve. Provides an overview of the attack surface and techniques used to test for XSS in React apps. He proceeds with an overview of the DevTools features he used. The XSS was in a BBCode URL tag which can point to steam:// URIs. The processes and thinking are described thoroughly.

        <h3>Interesting Research</h3>
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01161">Page Cache Attacks</a> 
        <p>
            A 14-page long academic article discussing side-channel page cache attacks. The most notable attacks are: <br />
            - An unprivileged process can monitor the timing of a function call in a shared library by evicting the relevant page from cache and monitoring when it is loaded back into cache. <br />
            - Covert process communication: 2 processes in 2 different sandboxes can communicate over page cache, treating each page as a bit. If the page is in the cache, then its value is 1; Otherwise, it’s 0.

        <a href="https://medium.com/yarden-shafir/yes-more-callbacks-the-kernel-extension-mechanism-c7300119a37a">Yes, More Callbacks — The Kernel Extension Mechanism</a> <i>#madeinisrael</i>
        <p>
            The story starts from a system crash that occurs during driver development when setting a kernel callback. Bam.sys fails to complete its initialization routine which leads to a system crash. Bam.sys uses an undocumented mechanism to set a kernel callback - called the Windows Kernel Host Extensions. Which is described in this article.

        <a href="https://www.cyberark.com/threat-research-blog/how-i-hacked-play-with-docker-and-remotely-ran-code-on-the-host/">How I Hacked Play-with-Docker and Remotely Ran Code on the Host</a> <i>#madeinisrael</i>
        <p>
            Found out the play-with-docker container is privileged and loaded a kernel module to escape to host.
