            Going through Twitter and blogs every day and filtering through the junk takes too much time. We figured others are having the same problem. Which is why we decided to compile a list of the interesting content that was published lately. We will publish every few weeks (when enough exciting things have happened).
        </p>
        <p>
            We would love to hear your thoughts! What was most interesting? What was missing? Any additional updates you would like to receive? You can send feedback by replying to this <a href="mailto:xnewsletter@extalio.com">email</a> (or just talking to us :)).
        </p>

        <p>
            RCE in Microsoft Edge’s ChakraCore found by 18-yo Jonathan from MSRC. A type-confusion in the JIT compiler causes the vulnerability. A JavascriptNativeFloatArray is mistaken for a JavascriptArray by abusing a state mismatch with array’s missing values functionality and type conversion through prototype assignment.  This confusion yields an RW primitive which can then be used to overwrite the stack with a ROP chain.

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg0J8nRIAhk">Modern Windows Userspace Exploitation</a> <i>#madeinisrael</i>
        <p>
            Overview of current mitigations, bypasses, and basic exploitation terminology (primitives) with concrete examples based on a CTF. Saar walks us through the exploitation process with increasing mitigations - first on windows7 with LFH, then on windows10 with LFH randomization and CFG, then on windows 10 with ACG, CIG, and a restriction on creating child processes. “The point in life is to execute arbitrary code :)”

            The first half of the lecture is about how to get into vulnerability research, how to get better, and the kind of mindset to have when looking for bugs. In the second half is about how to find vulnerabilities in Chrome IPC, giving a good overview of the system with tips on how to fuzz it.

        <p>
            A write-up about multiple vulnerabilities in FreeRTOS TCP/IP stack (in several of the major protocols) causing information leaks, DOS, and RCE.

        <p>
            A 5-part series is exposing several vulnerabilities with video conferencing applications, such as WebRTC, FaceTime, and Whatsapp. The articles start with an overview of the relevant protocols. In WebRTC (most common VC implementation used) Natashenka focuses on the “signaling” attack surface (before user interactions) - by fuzzing the RTP protocol and modifying chrome. The series provides researchers with the tools and hooks used during the research.

        <p>
            The Check Point security team discusses the process of finding more than 50 vulnerabilities in JP2KLib.dll (used as a parser by Adobe Reader). They don’t go into details of the vulnerabilities themselves, but rather describe the entire process of looking for them: from setting up the fuzzing environment to coding a wrapper around the DLL, and running WinAFL in optimal conditions.

        <p>
            A local privilege escalation bug in the systemd-tmpfiles process. The process makes sure not to operate on symlinked files but does not protect against a case where the symlink is part of the directory.

        <p>
            Found 3 vulnerabilities in VBScript, using grammar fuzzing. One allows writing to freed memory. The seconds allows an OOB read. And the last one causes a reference leak that can trigger a UAF bug. All 3 vulnerabilities are relatively simple.

            Identifying compiled third-party code is hard because of compiler setting variation. Thomas used hashing methods that preserve similarity between hashes in combination with deep learning. He talks about building the training set, the training, and provides examples of the results. Bottom line: simple string search is 90% as effective as this method.

            Mark Barnes analyzed the communication with smart Christmas lights reversed the firmware and used the endpoints to control the lights programmatically and make a snake game out of them. Along the way, found hardcoded credentials to the global MQTT server which can allow an attacker to power off all Christmas lights in the world potentially!

        <p>
            A quick write-up of SMBv2 support of symlinks. The lesser known feature described here is the ability to follow links on the server if a mount point exists. The method could be interesting for red teamers, but what was most interesting to me was James’ thought process when researching this.

        <a href="https://github.com/ionescu007/Simpleator">Windows-centric x64 user-mode application emulator</a>
        <p>
            A windows emulator POC by Alex Ionescu. 
            Ionescu’s primary goal was to hook and debug system calls for malware analysis easily and to show how easy it is to spin-up an emulated environment without a guest OS image using new windows API introduced in Redstone 4 and Redstone 5 updates.

        <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Kernel-Internals/Windows-Sandbox/ba-p/301849">Windows Sandbox</a>
        <p>
            A new sandbox by Microsoft that allows execution of untrusted code in an isolated and disposable environment. When the sandbox starts, it acts as a clean Windows installation, and when stopped everything is discarded. The post starts by presenting the features with a quick-start guide and then goes deeper into the internals of how the image is generated, how the memory is managed, how scheduling is done without disturbing the host, how such a light footprint is achieved through snapshotting, and more.

        <p>
            A malware analysis tool by Ariel Koren and Dr. Ran Dubin :) The tool fools the malware into thinking it is not running in a sandbox by creating wrappers around kernel functions. Even malware that sleeps before executing is tricked into executing immediately. It also has some unique features like RPC monitoring.
